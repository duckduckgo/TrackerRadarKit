## Building

`TrackerRadarKit` has no dependencies and is intended to be used as an imported Swift package.

It can be built manually two ways:

1. Build the  `TrackerRadarKit` scheme by opening the Swift package in Xcode
2. Run `swift build -c release` to build a release binary

### SwiftLint

We use [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) for enforcing Swift style and conventions, so you'll need to [install it](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint#installation).
